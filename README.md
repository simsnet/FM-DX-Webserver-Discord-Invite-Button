## Requirements

Because the plugin integrates into another application, an up-to-date version of NoobishSVK's [FM-DX Webserver](https://github.com/NoobishSVK/fm-dx-webserver) is required.

Additionally, a text editor with syntax highlighting/formatting (Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, Panic Nova) is highly recommended.
